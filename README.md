# Swarm Drone's Communication using Google Firebase database and PlaceMap API.

Worked on Google Cloud and Google Firebase for data storage. Additionally, created an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript-based website to simultaneously save longitude, latitude, and distance data from four distinct points. To store this data, I am utilizing Google Firebase. Using the Place Map API, I am able to calculate the distance between each point.
